# facebook-component

The code is build usig react where the data is fetched through an API (providing dummy data).
It covers concept of email and password authentication.
Email must includes @ sign and should end with .com.
Whereas password should have atleast 6 characters including at least one uppercase letter and one number. 

Once the customer is in, useEffect is used to fetch the data from a dummy api.
Then the same data is rendered on the screen in a facebook-styled component.
